#welcome to coding!

#This is just a normal text file. All we have done is named it hello.py.
#The .py extension makes it a python file, which means our text editor knows what the syntax should look like
#and we can run it by pressing cmd + B!


#lines that start with a hashtag/pound sign are commments.
#this means that they don't do anything. 
#it is also common to 'comment out' code that you do not want to run anymore


#our first code
print "Hello, world!"
